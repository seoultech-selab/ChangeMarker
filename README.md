# ChangeMarker
Change Marking Tool implemented based on Eclipse RCP.   
Product export needs to be done with `hk.ust.cse.pishon.esgen.products.product1`.

To write edit scripts for changes, first use `File > Load Changes` command to bring target changes into ChangeMarker.   
After writing edit scripts for the changes, you can use `File > Export Edit Scripts` command to export `.obj` file containing the scripts.

For analysis, you can load exported scripts using `File > Load Script Statistics` command or `File > Load Script from a Stored File` command.
